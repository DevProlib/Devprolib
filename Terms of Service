<h3><strong>Term; Termination; Effect of Termination</strong></h3>

<p>If these Terms of Services are terminated for any reasons, all provisions that by their nature should survive the Term will survive the Term, including, without limitation, any disclaimers and limitations of liability.</p>



<h3><strong>Export Control</strong></h3>



<p>You may not use or otherwise export or re-export the Services (including any technical information related thereto) except as authorized by applicable laws, including Canadian or American laws.

<h3><strong>Changes to the Terms of Services</strong></h3>



<p>We may change our Terms of Services at our sole discretion. If we do so, we will provide a notice to our users through the Services or otherwise.

<h3><strong>Prohibition of Class and Representation Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</strong></h3>



<p>You agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding. Unless we both agree otherwise, the courts may not consolidate or join more than one person’s or party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative or class proceeding. Also, the courts may award relief (including monetary, injunctive and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party’s individual claim(s), except that you may pursue a claim for and the arbitrator may award public injunctive relief under applicable law to the extent required for the enforceability of this provision.</p>



<h3><strong>Student Discount Offer Terms &amp; Conditions</strong></h3>



<p>Our Student Discount Offer is made available by Prolib (as defined herein) to students at an accredited higher education institute who meet the verification qualifications (each a “Qualifying Student”) for the BetterSleep (formerly Relax Melodies) app. The Student Discount Offer is currently only applicable to students of Canada colleges and universities and US Title IV degree granting colleges and universities. Prolib reserves the right to determine if you are a Qualifying Student in its sole discretion.</p>



<p>Qualifying Students are entitled to receive a discount on the annual price of the BetterSleep (formerly Relax Melodies) Paid Subscription (as defined herein) for as long as they maintain the requisite verification status. The Student Discount Offer may not be used in conjunction with any other promotion code or offer, past or present. Prolib shall automatically request re-verification of your student status for any renewal term. In addition to submitting the information necessary to perform the verification, you will also need to submit your payment details. By submitting the foregoing information, you (i) accept these Student Discount Offer Terms and Conditions; (ii) consent to our use of your provided information in accordance with our Privacy Policy; (iii) acknowledge and agree to these Terms of Service; and (iv) agree that at the expiration of your status as a Qualifying Student, you will automatically continue to subscribe to the Paid Subscription on an annual recurring basis, at the non-discounted price in effect at the time of any such renewal. If you do not want to continue to subscribe to the BetterSleep (formerly Relax Melodies) Paid Subscription at the end of the Discount Period, you may cancel your subscription at any time. Cancellation will take effect at the expiration of the then-current Discount Period.</p>



<p>Prolib reserves the right to terminate or modify this offer at any time for any reason.</p>



<h3><strong>General Legal Stuff</strong></h3>

<p>No waiver or consent to depart from the requirements of any provision of the Terms of Services will be binding. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Services shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>



<p>You may not assign or otherwise transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms of Services to any third party without the prior written consent of Us. No assignment or delegation by you shall relieve or release you from any of your obligations under these Terms of Services.</p>



<p>If any provision of the Terms of Services is found to be invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
